# shac

Shac (Scalable Hermetic Analysis and Checks) is a unified and ergonomic tool and
framework for writing and running static analysis checks.

Shac checks are written in [Starlark](https://bazel.build/rules/language).

1. `asciinema rec demo.cast`
  2. (in subshell) `shac check`
  3. (in subshell) Ctrl-D
4. Manually delete the last three lines of `demo.cast` corresponding to the Ctrl-D.
5. `agg --rows 25 --cols 88 --last-frame-duration 10 --font-size 48 demo.cast images/demo.gif`

## Usage

```shell
go install go.fuchsia.dev/shac-project/shac@latest
shac check
shac doc shac.star | less
```

## Documentation

* [doc/design.md](doc/design.md): High-level design information.
* [doc/stdlib.md](doc/stdlib.md): shac runtime standard library documentation.
* [doc/stdlib.star](doc/stdlib.star): shac runtime standard library starlark
  pseudo code.

## Road map

Planned features/changes, in descending order by priority:

* [x] Configuring files to exclude from shac analysis in `shac.textproto`
* [x] Include unstaged files in analysis, including respecting unstaged
  `shac.star` files
* [x] Automatic fix application with handling for conflicting suggestions
* [ ] Provide a `.shac` cache directory that checks can write to
* [ ] Mount checkout directory read-only
  * [x] By default
  * [ ] Unconditionally
* [ ] Give checks access to the commit message via `ctx.scm`
* [ ] Built-in formatting of Starlark files
* [ ] Configurable "pass-throughs" - non-default environment variables and
  mounts that can optionally be passed through to the sandbox
* [ ] Add `glob` arguments to `ctx.scm.{all,affected}_files()` functions for
  easier filtering
* [ ] Filesystem sandboxing on MacOS
* [ ] Windows sandboxing
* [ ] Testing framework for checks
